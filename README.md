## Features
- Reads 18 genes from user input (only A, T, S, L are accepted)
- Randomly selects 6 genes

- Calculates the weighted selection percentage for each gene

## Example Output
Enter 18 genes from A, T, S, or L: 
A T S L A S T L A T S L A T S L A T
Selected genes: [A, T, S, L, A, S]
A: 2
T: 1
S: 2
L: 1
Selection percentage of A: 33.33%
Selection percentage of T: 16.67%
Selection percentage of S: 33.33%
Selection percentage of L: 16.67%
